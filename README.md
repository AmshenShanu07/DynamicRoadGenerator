# Dynamic Road Builder
This will generate dynamic road using a curve path, each time we refresh curve point will be have random position ( the position x of curve point range from -6 to 6), also we can control the count of the curve point using lil Gui


## Issues 
- ~~Texture is stretching~~
- ~~Not able to maintain uniform width for tht road~~
